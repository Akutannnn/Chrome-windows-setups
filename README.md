# Chrome Windows Setups  

## What is Chrome Windows Setups?  

Chrome Windows Setups is a browser extension that saves and restores your entire Chrome workspace with one click.  

It is basically a tool to save and load Chrome windows and tabs disposition.

**Perfect for:**  
- Developers who switch between different projects with specific tabs and windows layouts  
- Students managing separate windows for different courses or research topics  
- Traders working with multiple charts using multiple Chrome Windows  
- Anyone who wants to quickly restore their browsing sessions without losing window positions  

## How It Works

## Known issues

Minimized windows are not saved.  
The extension can't get position or size information for minimized windows which are necessary when loading a window.  
Only non-minimized windows (normal, maximized, or fullscreen) will be included in saved setups.
